# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is the syntax language used in react that allows for the use of JavaScript logic within a React app html file. The main syntax difference between HTML and JSX being that JSX requires the use of curly braces {}. 

Researched answer: The difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX uses the syntax className where HTML uses class. JSX is what allows React to create user interfaces by interacting with the different React components.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator and is a package manager that was created by Facebook in 2016. It stores the different dependencies or files needed to run jest tests. Yarn modifies the React application by adding two files: package.json, and yarn.lock.

Researched answer: Yarn is necessary to create a React app due to the fact that a React Application is made of thousands of individual code snippets dependencies called node modules. The node modules must be organized in a particular order, and yarn ensures that they are correctly place for the framework of a React app.

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is a function that does not have a specified parameter for what type of argument can be passed through. This allows multiple types of data to be passed through a single function for continuous iteration for different scenarios. 

Researched answer: An anonymous function is a function that does not have any declared name for the function. Instead of using a function name to declare a function, ie. const functionName = () => {}, we can instead use function = () => {}. The function will only be called by a variable it is stored in as a function as a value. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: Props or properties are React tools that allow information to flow from one component(child) to component(child). State values allow us to use the properties from the component files inside the HTML script of the React App file. Props are specific to the components while state values are specific to the HTML script in the App folder.

Researched answer: State is a variable that stores data that determines how a component will be rendered as well as its behavior. If a component contains a data containing state variable, it is called a logic operator. If it does not, then it is called a display component. Props allows for the interconnectivity between components but do not require useState() syntax or a state variable in order to function.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer:Document Object Model (DOM) is a visual representation of HTML code. A website in a browser is a DOM. It allows for the smooth representation of a file or app and works within React allowing immediate feedback on any changes that occur during the coding process.

Researched answer: DOM essentially allows for the ability to get, change, add, or delete different HTML elements.
